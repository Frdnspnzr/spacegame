# Spacegame

Name pending (_or is it?_)

## Vision

I always asked myself how a game would feel where space travel was built the way it would realistically go: No fancy high speed dog fighting but rather staring and consoles, leaving most things to your board computer and hoping for the best. The X series kind of scratched that itch but never went far enough with it.

This absolutely is a hobby project and not even my priority or most time consuming hobby so progress will be slow. I don't have any illusion of this ever getting finished. Nonetheless I have a very strong vision of how this game _should_ work.

I envision the game to consist mainly of ressource management by reconfiguring the board computer on the fly. In the middle of fights players are expected to divert power from the engines to the shields, swapping out the navigation module for the repair nanobot controller and deactivating ineffective weapons to fire the other weapons more often.

The world should feel big but not arbitrary so I'd like to go with a mix of authored and generated content. Everything should be part of a big simulation without an overarching plot or big scripted events. Players should be free to trade between empires or disrupt this trade as pirates, joining the military force of a planet or accepting bounties as a freelancer. Yes, I wrote this paragraph knowing full well that I'm never going to achieve any of this in my lifetime.

## Contributions

I'm absolutely open to contributions. Just create issues when you encounter a bug, are unsure about anything or even if you have an idea what could make this game more fun. However I'm not willing to bend above vision to cater to different tastes so I'm going to be very critical of changes. However I'd be *honored* if people started forking this or building upon it in any other way so even if we're not on the same page about what this should be go and do your own thing and have fun while doing so. Be sure to shoot me a message, I'd *love* to have a look!

At the current stage I don't expect a big contribution guide or code of conduct to be necessary. Those are great tools of managing communities and this _will_ change as soon as people I don't know personally start discussion issues. Right now however I want to leave it at this:

Don't be a wangrod.
